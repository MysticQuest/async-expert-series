# Async expert course
### A series of exercises on async programming/multithreading in .NET

[Exercise repository](https://github.com/dotnetos/asyncexpert-course/tree/master)

### 1. Benchmark Dot Net
The code benchmarks four methods of calculating Fibonacci numbers: naive recursion, recursion with memoization (using a dictionary or list), and an iterative approach. Produces two result files (assembly & benchmarks).

### 2. Threading
- The project benchmarks different threading strategies in .NET for computing SHA256 hashes on data chunks, using direct threading, thread pool, and task-based asynchronous pattern. Produces a result file.
- Tests them with Moq and XUnit.
